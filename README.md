# typography

The terms typographer and letterpress printer cannot be used as synonyms. The real typographer should be an 'engineer' 
who has considerable knowledge of every stage of the printing process; she should has be an artist, capable of handling her 
type as a painter does her brushes and colors. Though her work may have a practical purpose, her skill shines through adding 
beauty to the work.
